    <h1>Parks List</h1>
    <h3>Big Bend</h3>
    <ul class="info">
        <li>Big Bend's busy season is generally November through April, and the park is often full to capacity during Thanksgiving week, Christmas holiday season, and spring break (mid March). Advance reservations for camping and lodging are highly recommended. To maximize your visit, plan ahead and have a flexible itinerary.</li>
        <li>Having a pet with you may limit some of your activities and explorations in the park. In addition, desert temperatures and predators are a serious threat to your pet's well being</li>
        <li>In addition to defining the curve that forms the Big Bend, the Rio Grande also serves as the international boundary between the United States and Mexico. more...</li>
        <li>The old adage "if you don't like the weather, just wait a minute," often holds true in Big Bend National Park. While Big Bend generally has blue skies and warm days, the weather can change quickly and dramatically.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Rio Grande</h3>
    <ul class="info">
        <li>Congress designated the Rio Grande Wild and Scenic River because of its outstandingly remarkable scenic, geologic, fish and wildlife, recreational, and other similar values.</li>
        <li>Rugged canyons, verdant riparian areas, scenic rapids, and unspoiled views contribute to the scenic allure and outstanding visual quality of this area.</li>
        <li>Rock layers exposed by the Rio Grande were deposited about 100 million years ago. Subsequent uplifting, folding, faulting, and cutting of the river have produced the present topography. Near its upstream end, the Rio Grande has sliced through the surrounding rocks to form steep-walled, sometimes narrow canyons. Downstream from Boquillas Canyon, the river flows across a relatively broad and open floodplain, or vega. Near Reagan Canyon, the floodplain narrows abruptly, and the river flows in a continuous deeply cut canyon for almost 40 miles. In the Lower Canyons portion of this segment, the river and its tributaries lie 500 to 1,500 feet below the surrounding plateaus.</li>
        <li>The Rio Grande Wild and Scenic River corridor represents an exceptional example of Chihuahuan Desert fauna in association with species that depend on the rare aquatic and riparian habitats of the river. It is an isolated outpost of rapidly dwindling and irreplaceable natural resources such as several fauna in association with species, including threatened and endangered species, that depend on the rare aquatic and riparian habitats of the river. A number of wildlife species (especially birds) use the Rio Grande as a travel corridor. Many species of animals depend on the riverine habitat for survival.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Padre Island</h3>
    <ul class="info">
    	<li>they release turtles</li>
    	<li>the average rainfall is 37 inches</li>
    	<li>winds average 12mph</li>
    	<li>Tiny invertebrates thrive in the mudflats where they often fall victim to the probing bills of wading birds.</li>
